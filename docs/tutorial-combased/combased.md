# Combased

is an amazing team of biz and code devs who consult at the edge of web3 and web2. They help traditional companies utilize NFT and blockchain tech, and build custom apps for clients. Even cooler, they work from a talent pool that is built around their NFT collection, and the team rewards contributions and NFT holders very generously.

[Visit Combased Discord](https://discord.gg/nh46kvc3Fa) for all the info about their dynamic and evolving reward programs, and to meet the founders and many of the people who help build the partnerships and apps.

Here is their official [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/combased_app).
